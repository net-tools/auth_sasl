# net-tools/auth\_sasl
Abstraction of various SASL mechanism responses ; compatibility with newer PHP releases (adapted from pear/auth_sasl)


# PHP 7.2 compliant
The package taken from [pear/auth\_sasl](https://github.com/pear/Auth\_SASL) has been updated to be compliant with newer PHP releases. It's now ok to use net-tools/auth\_sasl with PHP 7.2 (calls to `create_function` refactored to anonymous functions).
